# How to preview your changes locally on your desktop

Install Jekyll first: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

Clone this repo to your desktop via some Git client, e.g. Guthub Desktop.

Run these commands:

> cp Gemfile.local Gemfile \
> bundle install \
> bundle update \
> bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

Then open a browser page at http://127.0.0.1:4000 

Do NOT commit the Gemfile on your local desktop to Github Pages repo! 
It is needed only on your local host but not needed on the Guthub Pages.
